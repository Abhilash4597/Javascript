//React interview question....
//? 1. What is React ?
  //*  A JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces
  //*  Its aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications 

//? 2. Features of React ?
  //*  (JC OV SP)JSX,Components,one way data binding,Virtual Dom,Simplicity,Performance
  //*  JSX -JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
  //*       JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
  //*       JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
        
  //?  Components-Components are independent and they are reusable bits of code.
  //?             Components are of two types, Class components and Function components
  //?             Class Components:
  //?             A class component must include the extends React.Component statement.
  //?             The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.
              // Ex:- class Car extends React.Component {
              //      render() {
              //                 return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
              //                }
                  //  }
              //? Function Components:
              //* Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand
              // Ex:- function Car() {
              //        return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
              //      }
                   
  //*  One-way Data Binding- it describes a one-way data flow where the data flows from the parent to the child component, it is known as
  // *                       the unidirectional flow of data.
                         
  //*  Virtual DOM- The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory
  //*               and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
  // *              the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements 
               
  // ? Simplicity- ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple and to code as well as understand
  // ?             ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need. This makes it simple to use and learn.           
  
  //*  Performance-React allows us to measure the performance of our apps using the Profiler in the React DevTools.
