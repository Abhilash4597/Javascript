//# All the above Three points together are known as Full Stack Web Development.


//?______________________________________________ NETWORK :-
// * Bunch of resources like(computer/printer/mobile etc) are connected with each other or can be connected with each other and the system where all this resources exist in a connected form is known as a NETWORK.
// * They all can be connected in Wired form or Wireless form.

// * A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area, which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given large area with multiple buildings.
// * A MAN is larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller than a wide area network (WAN).
// * MANs do not have to be in urban areas; the term "metropolitan" implies the size of the network, not the demographics of the area that it serves.

//todo :- 3) WAN (Wide-Area Network) :-
// * A wide-area network (WAN) is a collection of local-area networks (LANs) or other networks that communicate with one another.
